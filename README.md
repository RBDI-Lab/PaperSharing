+ Peer-reviewed or top-tier preprints (e.g., arXiv, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL).

## Participation Rules

Everyone who wants to share papers should read the paper beforehand and answer the following questions.

+ What is the motivation behind this paper?

+ What key challenges does the paper aim to address?

+ How do you envision applying the methods from this paper to your own research?
