### 1. Why did you choose to share this paper?

I chose this paper because it is the first comprehensive survey on efficient reasoning in large language models (LLMs). With the rapid rise of reasoning-focused models like OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, efficiency has become a pressing bottleneck. This survey provides a clear taxonomy of methods, challenges, and benchmarks, making it an excellent resource for understanding the emerging field and inspiring research directions.

### 2. What is the motivation behind this paper?

The paper is motivated by the “overthinking phenomenon” in reasoning LLMs. While chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy, it often results in excessively long, redundant outputs that:
+ Increase inference cost and latency,
+ Reduce model responsiveness in real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving, real-time assistants),
+ Sometimes even introduce errors by over-elaborating.

Thus, the core motivation is to retain strong reasoning ability while minimizing unnecessary computation, enabling LLMs to be both accurate and efficient.

### 3. What key challenges does the paper aim to address?

The paper highlights several central challenges:
+ Trade-off between accuracy and efficiency – Long reasoning boosts accuracy but at the cost of speed and compute.
+ Conflicting training objectives – Pretraining and reinforcement learning often encourage longer reasoning, so enforcing conciseness works against existing optimization signals.
+ Lack of benchmarks and evaluation methods – There are limited tools for systematically measuring overthinking and reasoning efficiency.
+ Generality across models and tasks – Techniques that work for math or programming may not directly transfer to open-domain or multimodal reasoning.
