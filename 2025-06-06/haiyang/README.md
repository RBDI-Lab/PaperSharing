## HYPOTHESIS SEARCH:INDUCTIVE REASONING WITH LANGUAGE MODELS
### Why did you choose to share this paper?
The "hypothesis search" method proposed in this paper significantly improves the performance of LLMs in complex inductive reasoning tasks by combining abstract hypotheses generated by natural language with verifiable program implementations. The results demonstrate the potential of this method in complex reasoning tasks and are worthy of attention.
### What is the motivation behind this paper?
LLM implements inductive reasoning by “in-context learning”, but this kind of method performs poorly on complex tasks. Therefore, inspired by the human inductive reasoning process, the authors propose to improve the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs by generating and verifying multi-level hypotheses.
### What key challenges does the paper aim to address?
Poor performance in complex tasks: LLMs perform poorly in complex inductive reasoning tasks, especially in tasks such as ARC that require precise rule reasoning.
Lack of verifiable reasoning process: Traditional direct prompting methods lack intermediate verification steps, making it difficult to ensure the correctness of the reasoning process.
High computational cost: The computational cost of generating and verifying a large number of hypotheses and program implementations is high, limiting the practicality of the method.
### How do you envision applying the methods from this paper to your own research?
1. Automatically translate language rules generated by LLM into decision trees/Python rule functions;

2. The generated rules can be evaluated on historical data for accuracy or AUC, and high-performing rules can be retained as interpretable, reusable routing policies.
### How can the ideas in this paper be generalized to other areas or problems?
Domain adaptation and generalization: Hypotheses that generalize across multiple domains can be automatically discovered and validated, helping models adapt to new data distributions.
